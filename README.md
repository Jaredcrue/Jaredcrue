- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jared Stormer also known as @Jaredcrue. 
- ðŸ‘€ I've always been interested in tech and coding, even if I'm not the best at it. 
- I'm a bit of a space nerd aswell, I landed on the Mun, Minmus, and Duna. I've played thousands of hours in Elite Dangerous. God Speed Star Ship, SLS, and the many other rockets out there. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning lots, including web deveolpment, python, and maybe a sprinkle of C#. I should really try a game engine, to see what I can do there.
-     What I do need is some motivation, there are too many distractions in this world. My ADD mind does what it wants.
- ðŸ“« Look at my LinkedIn and Twitter accounts.
